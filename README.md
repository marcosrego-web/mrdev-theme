# Mr.Dev.'s Theme

Mr.Dev. is your provider of developing tools!

He gives you a boilerplate theme for Wordpress Blocks Full Site Editor and optionally for [Mr.Dev's Framework](https://marcosrego.com/development/mrdev-framework/).

Mr.Dev.'s Theme has the bare minimum styling needed to be compatible with default styles from Blocks, Mr.Dev and variables from [Mr.Utils](https://marcosrego.com/development/mr-utils/).

As oppose to [Mr.Dev_s](https://github.com/marcosrego-web/mrdev_s), Mr.Dev.'s Theme does not add styling or layout options to the framework. If you want some default styles, you can enable them on the framework instead.

By adding Mr.Dev.'s Framework to this theme, you will be able to use the plugin interface to add theme colors, typefaces, sizes, stylesheets, javascripts and [much more](https://marcosrego.com/development/mrdev-framework/#features).
