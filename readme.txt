== Description ==

Mr.Dev. is your provider of developing tools!

He gives you a boilerplate theme for Blocks Full Site Editor and optionally for [Mr.Dev's Framework](https://marcosrego.com/development/mrdev-framework/).

Mr.Dev.'s Theme removes the default colors from the full site editor and custom colors from the block editor (use the FSE to add custom colors).

It also has the bare minimum CSS styling needed to be compatible with default styles from Blocks, Mr.Dev and variables from [Mr.Utils](https://marcosrego.com/development/mr-utils/).

As oppose to [Mr.Dev_s](https://github.com/marcosrego-web/mrdev_s), Mr.Dev.'s Theme does not add styling or layout options to the framework. If you want some default styles, you can enable them on the framework instead.

By adding Mr.Dev.'s Framework, you will be able to use the plugin interface to add theme colors, typefaces, sizes, stylesheets, javascripts and [much more](https://marcosrego.com/development/mrdev-framework/#features).
